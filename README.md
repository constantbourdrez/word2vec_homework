# About This Project

This project is the second homework assignment for the LLM class in the IASD (Artificial Intelligence, Systems, and Data) Master Program 2023/2024 at PSL Research University (Universit√© PSL).

The focus of the project is the implementation of the Word2Vec model in Python, a widely used technique in both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLM). Additionally, it explores a classification task using a convolutional model, showcasing the application of transfer learning.

# Repository Structure

- **`2_hw_word2vec.ipynb`**: Contains the initial training and definition of the Word2Vec model.
- **`utils.py`**: Includes a wrapper for preprocessing, training, and evaluation of the Word2Vec model.
- **`2_hw_classifier.ipynb`**: Implements transfer learning for the classification task.
- **Model Weights**: Pretrained weights for different versions of Word2Vec are saved in the repository.
- **`config.yaml`**: Centralized configuration file for loading all parameters at once for ease of readability and modification.

# Report

The report detailing the project can be found in the repository as the only PDF file.
